nfCooldowns
===========

My cooldown buttons. The plan is to redevelop the core with a configurable GUI, and release it as Icebox.

Configuration
-------------

There's no proper configuration here. If you're proficient at Lua, you can fork and modify or rewrite `ui.lua`. The existing `ui.lua` is generously formatted, includes several necessary comments to get started writing your own, and has several tweakable constants for changing simple things like color, font, etc.
